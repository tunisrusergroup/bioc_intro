Welcome to this Carpentries course designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of data analysis using **R** and **Bioconductor**. This course will guide you through working with data, manipulating it effectively, and visualizing it to gain insights in the context of **bioinformatics**.

## Course Overview

In this course, we will cover:

-   The **data structures** in R and how to navigate them.
-   Techniques for **manipulating data** using tools from the `tidyverse`, like `dplyr` and `tibble`.
-   How to create **visualizations** with `ggplot2` to represent data in meaningful ways.

This course is tailored for those new to R and Bioconductor but assumes some familiarity with bioinformatics concepts.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   Understand and work with various data structures in R.
-   Perform data manipulation tasks using `dplyr` and `tidyverse` tools.
-   Visualize data using `ggplot2` and understand how to interpret the results.
-   Learn how to install and use Bioconductor packages to perform bioinformatics analyses.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes that participants:

-   Have basic knowledge of bioinformatics (though not required).
-   Have some familiarity with programming concepts, preferably with **R** (though not required).

## Course Materials

-   [Course Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/your-repo-link) â€“ Contains all the materials and code examples used in this course.
-   Datasets for the course will be provided within the lessons.
